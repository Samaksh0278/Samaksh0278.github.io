        <h2>I2GROW Systems Integration</h2>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> ROS1, ROS2, Python, SolidWorks, PLC, Mujoco</p>
        <p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Fall 2023 - Spring 2024</p>

        <p>
            This project involved the development of a <strong>controlled indoor hydroponic agricultural system</strong> designed to siphon household carbon dioxide emissions and optimize plant growth. 
            I implemented an advanced sensor pipeline in ROS to monitor environmental conditions and improve plant health.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydroponic System:</strong> Designed and implemented a fully controlled indoor hydroponic system that absorbs CO₂ emissions from households, helping reduce carbon footprint while promoting plant growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Twin of Lettuce Plants:</strong> Created a digital twin of lettuce plants using the <strong>NiCoLet model</strong>, allowing us to predict plant growth with high accuracy (88%). The model was trained on real-time environment data collected through a sensor pipeline integrated with ROS.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project showcases my ability to integrate <strong>mechanical design</strong> and <strong>sensor technologies</strong> with <strong>ROS</strong> for real-world agricultural applications, bridging the gap between environmental sustainability and technology.
