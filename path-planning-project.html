        <h2>Learning-Based Robot Navigation</h2>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, ROS, Gazebo, CVAE, LSTM, PyPose</p>
        <p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Fall 2023</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            We introduce a unified learning-based framework for real-time autonomous navigation in complex environments, integrating perception and path planning into a
single pipeline. Building upon the iPlanner, an end-to-end policy planning model
originally developed for ground robots, we adapt its Bi-Level Optimization (BLO)
process for efficient navigation, creating safe and dynamically feasible trajectories through an improved state representation and incorporating spatiotemporal
dependencies within the network. Central to our approach is the application of
a pre-trained Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) which efficiently
extracts crucial features from depth images and simultaneously mitigates highfrequency noise. The low-dimensional rich information is fused with an expanded
goal representation to feed downstream planning tasks. We exploit the spatiotemporal sequential nature of the planning task with Long short-term memory
(LSTM) networks to generate an extended sequence of keypoint paths. Our loss
function uses the optimization process to prioritize the safety and dynamic feasibility of the paths generated. We train our model entirely in simulated environments,
employing various data augmentation techniques to reduce the sim2real gap. We
present the results of our ablation study for our pre-trained CVAE, trained our
end-to-end pipeline, and show comparable results to iPlanner while succeeding
in cases where large obstacles are present. We also show our Navigation Success
Rate is around 88 % which is close to the iPlanner paper (86 %) while being very
light. Finally, we set the stage for future hardware implementation.

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>
            The project utilized a Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) process to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The perception module employed a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to extract low-dimensional feature representations from depth images. This reduced noise and enhanced the perceptual quality of the system. The planning network then used these features along with the goal position to generate keypoint paths through an LSTM-based sequence generator. Each keypoint was optimized using a cubic spline interpolation for smooth transitions between waypoints. Data augmentation techniques such as blur, gamma correction, and random noise were applied to make the system robust against real-world environmental conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3>
        <p>
            In conclusion, our Bi-Level Optimization framework demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art models in complex navigation scenarios, achieving an 88% navigation success rate. However, the number of keypoints remains a hard-coded hyperparameter that constrains the system in some scenarios. Future work will focus on dynamic keypoint generation based on real-time environmental feedback to improve adaptability. Additionally, we plan to extend this work to hardware implementations and reduce model size further to fit on embedded systems for real-time operations.
