        <h2>Imperative Path Planning</h2>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, ROS, Isaac Sim</p>
        <p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Fall 2023</p>

        <p>
            This project involved the development of a novel <strong>unsupervised learning approach</strong> to train a path planning policy for robot perception and navigation. The goal was to enhance the robot's ability to navigate complex environments with minimal data.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unsupervised Path Planning:</strong> Designed and implemented an unsupervised learning method to train a robot's path planning policy, significantly improving its perception and navigation capabilities without requiring large labeled datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Bi-level Trajectory Optimization:</strong> Addressed the limitations of conventional unsupervised learning techniques by employing a bi-level trajectory optimization strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in <strong>zero-shot obstacle avoidance</strong> and <strong>waypoint generation</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project demonstrates my expertise in <strong>robotic navigation</strong> and <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>, showing how advanced optimization techniques can enhance a robot's ability to navigate and avoid obstacles in real-time.
