        <h2>Learning-Based Robot Navigation</h2>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, ROS, Gazebo, CVAE, LSTM, PyPose</p>
        <p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Fall 2023</p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            We introduce a unified learning-based framework for real-time autonomous navigation in complex environments, integrating perception and path planning into a single pipeline. Building upon the iPlanner, an end-to-end policy planning model originally developed for ground robots, we adapt its Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) process for efficient navigation, creating safe and dynamically feasible trajectories through an improved state representation. This framework incorporates spatiotemporal dependencies using a pre-trained Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system is trained entirely in simulated environments, reducing the sim-to-real gap and achieving high navigation success rates in challenging environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p>
            The project utilized a Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) process to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The perception module employed a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to extract low-dimensional feature representations from depth images. This reduced noise and enhanced the perceptual quality of the system. The planning network then used these features along with the goal position to generate keypoint paths through an LSTM-based sequence generator. Each keypoint was optimized using a cubic spline interpolation for smooth transitions between waypoints. Data augmentation techniques such as blur, gamma correction, and random noise were applied to make the system robust against real-world environmental conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3>
        <p>
            In conclusion, our Bi-Level Optimization framework demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art models in complex navigation scenarios, achieving an 88% navigation success rate. However, the number of keypoints remains a hard-coded hyperparameter that constrains the system in some scenarios. Future work will focus on dynamic keypoint generation based on real-time environmental feedback to improve adaptability. Additionally, we plan to extend this work to hardware implementations and reduce model size further to fit on embedded systems for real-time operations.
