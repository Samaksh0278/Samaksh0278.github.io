        <h2>Segmentation on Open-Source Datasets</h2>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, Computer Vision</p>
        <p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Spring 2024</p>

        <p>
            I worked on improving segmentation performance for complex datasets by developing a 
            <strong>novel diffusion model architecture</strong> to generate labeled synthetic data. This approach helped augment 
            open-source datasets, increasing the size of training data and resulting in an <strong>8% improvement in test accuracy</strong> due to better generalizability.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Synthetic Data Generation:</strong> The diffusion model I developed generated high-quality, labeled synthetic data that enhanced the open-source datasets, leading to better model performance during testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving Feature Representations:</strong> I focused on refining feature representations, particularly for complex areas such as <strong>hair and facial features</strong> on divergent test data. This improved the classification accuracy for detailed parts.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Object Masks:</strong> By utilizing high-quality object masks, the project also improved the mask quality of the open-source datasets, ensuring better segmentation results.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project highlights my expertise in <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, specifically in using advanced architectures to improve model performance through better data augmentation and feature refinement.
