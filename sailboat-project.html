        <h2>Optimal Control of an Autonomous Sailboat</h2>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> JULIA, Python, MATLAB</p>
        <p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> Spring 2024</p>

        <p>
            In this project, I developed a <strong>multi-level control system</strong> for an autonomous sailboat. The control system integrated multiple advanced optimization techniques to improve the sailboat's navigation and control in real-world conditions.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Route Optimization (RRT*):</strong> I implemented a global route optimization algorithm, known as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT*), which helps the sailboat find the most efficient path to its destination while avoiding obstacles in the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Trajectory Optimization and Model Predictive Control (MPC):</strong> After determining the global route, I used trajectory optimization and MPC to refine the sailboat's movements, reducing its <strong>navigation error by 15%</strong>. MPC continuously updated the sailboat's path based on current data, ensuring smooth, real-time adjustments to the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving Accuracy:</strong> By using data from the <strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</strong>, I tested the system in a real-world scenario and improved the sailboat's accuracy by <strong>20%</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Techniques:</strong> I also compared two optimization methods, <strong>direct collocation</strong> and <strong>iLQR (Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator)</strong>, to ensure that the system achieved both accuracy and efficient computation time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project demonstrates my ability to apply <strong>control theory</strong> and <strong>optimization techniques</strong> to real-world problems, pushing the limits of what's possible in autonomous navigation systems.
