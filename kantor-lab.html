        <h2>Graduate Research Assistant</h2>
        <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science, CMU</p>
        <p><strong>Lab:</strong> Kantor Lab</p>
        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> ROS1, ROS2, Docker, Pytorch, C++, Arduino</p>
        <p><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> May 2024 - Aug 2024</p>

        <p>
            As a Graduate Research Assistant at the Robotics Institute, I developed a system for <strong>3D point cloud modeling of occluded fruits</strong> in orchards using advanced algorithms and robotic techniques.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>3D Point Cloud Modeling:</strong> Developed a 3D point cloud system using the <strong>RAFT stereo algorithm</strong> to model occluded fruits in orchard environments, enabling accurate detection even in cluttered scenes.</li>
            <li><strong>Segmentation and Tracking:</strong> Implemented <strong>YOLOv8</strong> for fruit segmentation and enhanced the tracking process with an augmented <strong>DeepSORT algorithm</strong> to maintain tracking consistency across frames.</li>
            <li><strong>Leafblower Actuation System:</strong> Designed and implemented an innovative <strong>leafblower actuation system</strong> controlled via inverse kinematics on servo motors, which cleared obstructions to reveal occluded fruits.</li>
            <li><strong>ROS-Based Docker Deployment:</strong> Deployed the entire solution in a <strong>ROS-based Docker container</strong>, allowing for seamless integration with field robotics systems for real-time orchard monitoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Improvement in Detection Accuracy:</strong> Achieved up to <strong>35% improvement</strong> in occluded fruit detection accuracy compared to baseline models, significantly enhancing the system's performance in practical applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This project highlights my skills in <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>robotics</strong>, and <strong>system integration</strong> for agricultural automation, contributing to advancements in smart farming technologies.
